Introduction to Idea - 

NFT HUNT - My idea is a mobile application for NFT Hunting, which would incorporate the concept
of augmented reality (AR) using the user's phone camera. The application will have 3 options :-

1. Start Hunting :- 
User clicks this button and starts hunting for NFTs (similar to hunting of Pokemon in Pokemon Go).
User receives notification if NFT is within 5 metre radius of area of his location and guided to move to it
User finds NFT and collects it in his wallet by clicking on it (NFT will be debited from it’s owner’s account)
NFT gets collected in user’s OpenSea account in “NFT_HUNT” named collection

2. Connect OpenSea account option :- Used to connect the respective OpenSea account of the user.

3. Settings :- Volume settings, Text Size Settings etc.
